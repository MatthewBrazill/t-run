  - Backward: Left Arrow; a
  - Jump: Up Arrow; w
  - Duck: Down Arrow; s
  - Sprint: Shift

  Press SHIFT+A+ALT to deactivate the hit detection. To turn hit detection back on, restart the game. Debugg mode also 
  makes Rexy faster.

  If you hit the grey stones, Rexy should die. The placement of the stones is supposed to be randomly generated at the start of every 
  game, and should only be gererated so that it is possible. Throughout the game the ablient music should play, 
  but when Rexy dies the death music, and when Rexy gets home the finish music should play.
